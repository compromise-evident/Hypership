# How it works; infinitely splicing finitude

Number files are 150 Bytes (72-character numbers shared as 150-Byte strings, those extra characters are space where a new number is constructed over time--one bit per event. Study Authorship thoroughly before studying the following. Here, splicing works like a zipper--splicing finite pre-computed nested chains using the infinity of Authorship. 504 authentication events are pre-generated and nested right-to-left with automatic numbers concatenated with 2 ciphertext then hashed. <br/> <br/>

After 504 events, 504 bits represent the full new 72-character number; 1 key per event reveals the next bit through the automatic message. Hypership is without user
