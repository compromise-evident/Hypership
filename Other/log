/*	Hypership log



Version 1.0.0   It has been possible since discovering Authorship but only later
                became apparent that using  Authorship  to splice  pre-generated
                nested chains is a good idea, at some cost, such as reduced data
                authentication.  Hypership  can easily be built to include extra
                message functions in the list but it's better leaving it minimal
                so if anyone creates  (as I will be, over time)  new  Authorship
                systems variable in user message size, those systems can work in
                unison; verifying parties retain 2 different numbers for 1 user.
                Numbers here are still as they are in Authorship in a sense that
                verifying parties must always have  1  number from the modifying
                party; for each event,  the verifying party is left with one new
                number--this truth you can't escape for the authentication style
                of Authorship. If you think Hypership is too tiny to accommodate
                a new number every time, study the documentation very carefully.
